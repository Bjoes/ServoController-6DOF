# 6 DOF Simulator with arduino controller for FlyPT Mover
Controlled by 2 arduino mega 2560 in FlyPT Mover. (see code and documentations in Arduino folder)

AASD-15a drives with 80st-m02430 servoes

Fully modular, build with aluminium extrusions, laser cut brackets and 3d printed parts.

Everything is avaiable in the CAD drawings except nuts, bolts and bearings for the frame, joints and brackets. (WIP for BOM)

For the actuator design follow Departed reality's design. Only thing modified from his files are the rod ends. 
I use a U-joint at the bottom to prevent the actuator from rotating, which are shown in the cad drawings on this page. 
This requires slight modification on the bottom part that fastens the u-joint to the actuator.
